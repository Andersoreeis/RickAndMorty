        <p>This project is a tribute to the comedy and science fiction animated series, Rick and Morty.</p>
        <p>It includes detailed information about the characters and features of the series.</p>
        <p>To gather this information, I used a public API known as The Rick and Morty API.</p>
        <p>I built this website using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
            <li>PUBLIC API</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>On the home page, you'll find information about the series and the API, as well as the option to search for your favorite characters by name. On the characters page, you can see a complete list of all the characters featured in the series. To get more information about a specific character, simply click on their image and a detailed page with information about the character will be displayed. I created a custom pagination to ensure that navigating through the site was easy and intuitive.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy the end result!</p>
        <p>I want to express my gratitude to the Rick and Morty API for making it possible to explore and discover incredible information about the series. Your hard work and dedication are greatly appreciated by fans. Thank you for creating this engaging experience! üôèüëè</p>
